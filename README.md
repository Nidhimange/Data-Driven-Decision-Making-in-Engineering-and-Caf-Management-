## Project: Data-Driven Decision Making in Engineering and Café Management
- **Overview:** This project explores the integration of data-driven decision-making within the fields of engineering and café management. Conducted through in-depth interviews with industry leaders, the study reveals how advanced analytics and leadership in data utilization shape operational efficiency and strategic planning in diverse sectors. Jonathan Rojas from the University of the Pacific's DUC Cafeteria and Sachin Kaliye from Ironcraft Engineering Solutions provided insights into how their organizations leverage data to predict outcomes, reduce waste, and enhance customer satisfaction.
- **Technologies Used:** The project utilized qualitative analysis tools to synthesize interview data, with a focus on how predictive analytics and machine learning are applied in practice. Techniques involved include data collection from operational metrics, predictive modeling for inventory and quality control, and integration of AI-driven systems for real-time decision-making.
- **What I Learned:** The project deepened my understanding of the practical applications of data analytics in different management contexts. I learned about the challenges of implementing technology-driven solutions across varied industries and the critical role of leadership in fostering an innovative, data-centric culture. This experience highlighted the importance of aligning technology with strategic business goals to drive meaningful improvements and efficiencies.
